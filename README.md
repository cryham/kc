Keyboard Controler
==================

This is the start of my own USB Keyboard Controler on Teensy 3.2 with TFT ST7735 display. Called K.C. ("Kacey") for short.

It uses code from repositories:
* [PaulStoffregen cores](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/cores/tree/master/teensy3) for teensy 3 core,
* [sumotoy TFT_ST7735](https://github.com/sumotoy/TFT_ST7735/tree/1.0p1) for fast TFT ST7735 display
* [Adafruit-GFX-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) for drawing, combined with above
